<h2>Most interesting thing I did with my Web Development skills:</h2>

	<p>
	<font size="+2">
I actually have not done any extensive web development before this class. I would say the most interesting thing I did last year in engineering 102 was I created a webpage that had my information and a link to my resume as part of an assignment for the class. I hope to learn a lot about web development in this class so my applications can look better.

<h2>Have I signed up for the Campuswire Forum:</h2>


	<p>
	<font size="+2">
I have signed up for the Campuswire forum and I think that the concept of it could be extremely helpful to me in the class. For other CS classes I relied on discord however I think that Campuswire will be my home for HW questions this term.

<h2>Something interesting about me:</h2>

	<p>
	<font size="+2">
One thing that I think is interesting about me is that I used to live in Abu Dhabi for 5 years before I came back to the US junior year of high school. The funny thing is that when I tell people this most don't know where it is so I just say Dubai since both cities are very close to each other in the United Arab Emirates. While living in Abu Dhabi it was surreal I saw Ferraris and Lambos driving down the highway and this was an every day thing. The food was amazing I particularly love chicken shawarma. Also fun fact, in the summer over there it can get up to 50 C which literally made me a hermit in my house during the summers.
