<h2>Assignment 1 Entry: 9/28/2022</h2>
<br>

<p>
The main challenge that I had with this assignment was getting up to speed on HTML again because it has been about a year since I made my last webpage. I had to do a large amount of googling to be able to get my code to run with the proper tags. I did learn with this assignment that I can use Github desktop to make commits to my online repository much easier. I do have experience using the terminal with GIT however it was nice to know that there is an easier way of going about it. Also revising some of the GitHub commands was very helpful and I even learned some new ones like git log. I can see myself enjoying this class because web development is so broad and I feel like I will never get bored of the course content since there is so much for me to learn. The only resource that I used for this assignment was the class lecture getting back up to speed on GIT as well as google for learning certain HTML tags.
